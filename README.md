# optimal-camera-placement
Code for optimal camera placement software. Written on c++ using qt creator. Requires various external libraries such as -
1) VTK
2) ITK
3) binVox tool
4) IBM CPLEX
5) boost
6) EIGEN
7) openGL
8) openCL

The code is still in development phase. This project is for research in camera placement algorithms to design a multiple camera system to
to achieve surround view visualization of vehicle surroundings.
